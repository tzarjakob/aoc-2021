## Day 13 special notes

The [program](./main.ts) also generates a ppm image (format to show result very easily without any dependencies, [credits to this video for the idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJIyRE2vZ_0)). The image shows the final result.

Ps. For linux distros, `feh` is a very good tool to display such format.

``` console
feh -B black -g 600x300 output.ppm
```
